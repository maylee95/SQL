#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND Product = 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT c.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers c
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales 
ON c.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT DISTINCT Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price IN
(SELECT MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).
SELECT Product, SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity), SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for thosee customers?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT c.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.customers c
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales 
ON c.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
AND FebSales.Quantity > 2;
