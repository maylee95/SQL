# In this project, I'm querying a database that represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.

#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country <> 'USA';

#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country = 'Brazil';

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. 
The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, i.InvoiceId, i.InvoiceDate, i.BillingCountry
FROM customers c
OUTER JOIN invoices i
ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
WHERE i.BillingCountry = 'Brazil';

#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT * 
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. 
The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT i.invoiceId, e.FirstName, e.LastName
FROM invoices i
JOIN customers c ON c.customerid = i.customerid
JOIN employees e ON c.supportrepid = e.employeeid
WHERE e.title = 'Sales Support Agent';

#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT i.total, c.firstname AS cust_fn, c.lastname AS cust_ln, c.country, 
e.FirstName AS emp_fn, e.LastName AS emp_ln
FROM invoices i
JOIN customers c ON c.customerid = i.customerid
JOIN employees e ON c.supportrepid = e.employeeid;

#8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#9. What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT InvoiceLineId, tracks.Name
FROM invoice_items i
JOIN tracks ON i.trackid = tracks.TrackId;

#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT InvoiceLineId, t.Name, a.name
FROM invoice_items i
JOIN tracks t ON i.trackid = t.TrackId
JOIN albums ON t.albumid = albums.AlbumId
JOIN artists a ON albums.Artistid = a.artistid;

#12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT t.name, a.title, g.name, m.name
FROM tracks t
JOIN albums a ON t.albumid = a.albumid
JOIN genres g ON t.genreid=g.genreid
JOIN media_types m ON t.mediatypeid=m.mediatypeid;

#13. Show the total number of sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT e.firstname, e.lastname, COUNT(i.invoiceid) AS NumberOfSales
FROM invoices i
JOIN customers c ON c.customerid = i.customerid
JOIN employees e ON c.supportrepid = e.employeeid
WHERE e.title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY e.firstname, e.lastname;

#14. Show the total revenue made made by each sales agent.
SELECT e.firstname, e.lastname, ROUND(SUM(Total), 2) AS TotalRevenue
FROM invoices i
JOIN customers c ON c.customerid = i.customerid
JOIN employees e ON c.supportrepid = e.employeeid
WHERE e.title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY e.firstname, e.lastname;

#15. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT e.firstname, e.lastname, ROUND(SUM(i.total), 2) AS TotalSales
FROM invoices i
JOIN customers c ON c.customerid = i.customerid
JOIN employees e ON c.supportrepid = e.employeeid
WHERE e.title = 'Sales Support Agent'
AND i.InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31'
GROUP BY e.firstname, e.lastname
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC
LIMIT 1;
